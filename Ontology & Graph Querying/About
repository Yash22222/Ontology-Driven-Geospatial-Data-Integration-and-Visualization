# Ontology & Graph Querying


In this project, we aim to build an ontology representing major cities in Israel and their connections. 
An ontology provides a structured framework to represent knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.

Key Components

1. Classes (Concepts): City: Represents a city entity.
2. Individuals (Instances): Each city (e.g., Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa) is an instance of the City class.
3. Properties:  rdf:type: Defines the type of the resource, which in this case is City.
                schema:name: Represents the name of the city.

RDF Triples
An RDF (Resource Description Framework) triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. In this case:

1. Subject: The URI representing a city (e.g., http://sws.geonames.org/281184 for Jerusalem).
2. Predicate: The property or attribute (e.g., rdf:type, schema:name).
3. Object: The value of the attribute (e.g., City type, city name).


Understanding the Ontology and Graph Querying

1. Ontology
An ontology defines a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of a domain. In this case, the domain is geographical locations (cities) within Israel. 
By creating an ontology, we ensure that each city is represented in a standardized manner, allowing for consistent data integration, sharing, and querying.

2. Graph Querying
Once the ontology is created and populated with data (RDF triples), you can query the RDF graph using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). 
SPARQL queries enable you to retrieve specific information from the graph, such as finding all cities, getting their names, or exploring relationships between cities.

Practical Applications

1. Data Integration: Combining data from different sources into a unified framework.
2. Semantic Search: Enabling more accurate searches based on the meaning of terms.
3. Data Analysis: Analyzing relationships and patterns within the data.
4. Geospatial Visualization: Creating maps and visual representations of the data.

Summary
This ontology-driven approach provides a structured and interoperable way to represent and query information about cities in Israel. By leveraging RDF and SPARQL, 
we can create rich, interconnected datasets that facilitate advanced data integration, analysis, and visualization.
