# Geospatial Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the integration and visualization of geospatial data using various datasets. The primary goal is to provide insights into different geospatial features and administrative divisions within Israel and Palestine. The project utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) extracts and Natural Earth shapefiles to achieve this.

## Conceptual Framework

### Ontology-Driven Integration and Visual Analytics for Geospatial Data

The project employs ontology-driven techniques to annotate and integrate geospatial data. This approach enhances the semantic understanding and visualization of spatial data. The project demonstrates a comprehensive method for ontology-driven data integration and visual analytics by linking RDF entities with spatial features.

## Data Sources

1. **OpenStreetMap (OSM) Extracts**
   - **Description**: Provides detailed and up-to-date geospatial data, including roads, buildings, and various other features.
   - **Download Link**: [Geofabrik Download Page](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
   - **Instructions**: Select the relevant extracts for Israel or Palestine.

2. **Natural Earth Shapefiles**
   - **Description**: Source for administrative boundaries and other geographic features.
   - **Download Link**: [Natural Earth Download Page](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/)
   - **Instructions**: Download shapefiles for administrative boundaries.

## Steps to Download and Prepare Data

1. **Download OSM Data**
   - Visit the [Geofabrik download page](https://download.geofabrik.de/).
   - Choose the appropriate extracts based on your region of interest (Israel or Palestine).
   - Download the shapefiles and other relevant files.

2. **Extract and Prepare Shapefiles**
   - Visit the [Natural Earth download page](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/).
   - Download shapefiles for administrative boundaries and other geospatial features.
   - Ensure that all necessary files (e.g., `.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`) are present and correctly extracted.

## Data Visualization

The project involves visualizing various geospatial datasets to understand spatial features and administrative boundaries:

- **Points of Interest (POIs)**
- **Transport Networks**
- **Water Bodies**
- **Railways**
- **Roads**
- **Traffic**
- **Waterways**
- **Buildings**

Visualizations are created using Python libraries like `matplotlib`, `plotly`, and `geopandas` to display and analyze the data effectively.

## Theory and Concepts

### Administrative Divisions in Israel

Administrative divisions refer to the different levels of government subdivisions within a country. In Israel, these include various administrative regions such as districts, municipalities, and local councils. Understanding these divisions is crucial for regional governance, resource management, and demographic studies.

### Geospatial Data Overview

Geospatial data provides information about geographic locations and features on Earth's surface. This project encompasses various types of geospatial data, including points of interest, transportation networks, water bodies, and more. The goal is to offer a comprehensive view of the spatial landscape and facilitate informed decision-making.

### Graph Querying
Once the ontology is created and populated with data (RDF triples), you can query the RDF graph using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). SPARQL queries enable you to retrieve specific information from the graph, such as finding all cities, getting their names, or exploring relationships between cities.

### Practical Applications
- **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources into a unified framework.
- **Semantic Search**: Enabling more accurate searches based on the meaning of terms.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing relationships and patterns within the data.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Creating maps and visual data representations.
